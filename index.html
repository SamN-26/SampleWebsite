          <p class="paragraph">
            Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. The band comprised Freddie Mercury
             (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) 
            and John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, 
            hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional 
            and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.

              Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991)[2] was a British singer 
              and songwriter, who achieved worldwide fame as the lead vocalist of the rock band Queen. Regarded as
               one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and 
               four-octave vocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his theatrical style, influencing 
               the artistic direction of Queen.
