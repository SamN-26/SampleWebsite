            Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. The band comprised Freddie Mercury
             (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) 
            and John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, 
            hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional 
            and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.

                Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with 
                more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name "Queen". Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before 
                the band released their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer Heart Attack 
                later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured "Bohemian Rhapsody", which stayed at number 
                one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format.
